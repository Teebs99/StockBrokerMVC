# StockBrokerMVC

# Portfolio
This houses a list of orders and those orders stocks. Make sure that the orders are filled otherwise it won't affect the portfolio's value

# Orders
This is where you choose what stock you want to buy or sell. Go into the details view to fill the order manually. A stock must exist before you can create an order

# Stocks
This is the foundation of the project. I would make sure that there is a stock created before doing anything else in the project. Otherwise you risk errors with null object values.
